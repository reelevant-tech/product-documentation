## OAuth2

We currently implement a system similar to OAuth2 with the following `grant_type`:

- **`password`**: Requires a `username` (which is generally the user's email) and a `password`.
- **`refresh_token`**: Requires a valid `refresh_token`

We currently require providing a `client_id` for each grant. If you don't have one, please contact us at `[email protected]` to obtain one.

<Warning>
  We currently don't have a way to find/create/delete refresh tokens from the UI, but you can find/use the one inside the cookies of `https://app.reelevant.com` under the key `refresh_token`.
</Warning>

## Getting Tokens

The endpoint used to retrieve tokens is `POST https://api.reelevant.com/v2/auth/token` with a `application/json` `Content-Type`.

### Using Username and Password

Here is an example to get tokens based on a `username`/`password`:

<CodeGroup>

```bash
curl -XPOST https://api.reelevant.com/v2/auth/token \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "username": "myemail",
    "password": "mypassword",
    "grant_type": "password",
    "client_id": "<client_id>"
  }'
```

</CodeGroup>

### Using Refresh Token

And here is if you already have a `refresh_token`:

<CodeGroup>

```bash
curl -XPOST https://api.reelevant.com/v2/auth/token \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "refresh_token": "myrefreshtoken",
    "grant_type": "refresh_token",
    "client_id": "<client_id>"
  }'
```

</CodeGroup>

## Using Access Tokens

After getting a valid `access_token`, you'll need to add it for every call to the gateway within the `Authorization` header like so:

```
Authorization: Bearer ${access_token}
```

<Info>
  **Token expirations**
  
  Access tokens are valid for 1h after creation whereas refresh tokens are valid for 30 days starting from the last access token generation (so if you refresh it once a month, it doesn't expire).
